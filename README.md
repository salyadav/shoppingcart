Some CSS Notes: 

flex-grow: value of 1 so that it both expands the flex container to full width and expands itself to full the remaining space.
Ensures that the row of products always fills the entire space.

flex-basis: alloting 16% width of th container width to the flex items.

align-self: (flex-end/flex-start etc) to align the content of the flex item as center, right, left etc.
